UserScripts for Canvas LMS

<b>Canvas Crosslisting.user.js</b> is a very basic tool in which the user inputs the course number of the parent course and child course and then the two are crosslisted together.

<b>instructor and admin crosslisting tools.js</b> is a more robust script in which the instructor's current term courses are loaded in a dropdown menu to choose the parent course. Then the remaining courses are dynamically created and are selectable to be child courses. Finally, the instructor can rename the parent course and submit to finalize the crosslisting and renaming actions. The instructor can also choose to crosslist without renaming and rename without crosslisting. On the subaccount page, it also adds the ability for admins to search for a user and then perform the same tasks as an instructor.
