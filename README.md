UserScripts for Canvas LMS

Canvas Crosslisting.user.js is a very basic tool in which the user inputs the course number of the parent course and child course and then the two are crosslisted together.

Canvas Crosslisting Instructor Tool.user.js is a more robust script in which the instructor's current term courses are loaded in a dropdown menu to choose the parent course. Then the remaining courses are dynamically created and are selectable to be child courses. Finally, the instructor can rename the parent course and submit to finalize the crosslisting and renaming actions. The instructor can also choose to crosslist without renaming and rename without crosslisting as well.
